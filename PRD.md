You set up one small FestFlow box at your event and create a local WiFi. Everyone connects to it with their phone, tablet, or screen. No apps to install. No internet needed. Just open a website.

Once connected, each person sees exactly what they need.

The waiters:
	•	Open FestFlow in their phone browser
	•	Select a table
	•	Tap the food and drinks
	•	Add notes for special wishes
	•	Send the order
	•	See which of their orders are still open
	•	See an estimated waiting time

The kitchen:
	•	Opens FestFlow on a tablet or TV
	•	Sees all food orders instantly
	•	Orders are sorted by waiting time
	•	Can group by product to prepare many items at once
	•	Marks orders as done when finished
	•	A receipt can be printed automatically

The bar:
	•	Works exactly like the kitchen
	•	Only sees drink orders
	•	Marks them done when prepared
	•	Hands drinks to the runners

The organizer:
	•	Opens the admin view
	•	Sets up:
	•	Menu and prices
	•	Tables and seating
	•	Kitchen, bar, grill, coffee stations
	•	Can mark products as sold out so they cannot be ordered anymore
	•	Sees how busy each area is
	•	Downloads reports after the event

Everything happens live:
	•	When a waiter sends an order, it appears instantly in kitchen and bar
	•	When kitchen finishes, the waiter sees it
	•	No shouting, no paper, no confusion

If something is wrong:
	•	Orders can be canceled
	•	Items can be changed
	•	Sold-out food disappears automatically from the menu

At the end of the event you can:
	•	Download a simple file for Excel
	•	See:
	•	Total revenue
	•	Revenue per product
	•	Revenue per waiter
	•	Best-selling items
	•	Busy hours

For you it feels like this:

You turn on the system.
You open the WiFi.
Everyone connects.
The event runs.

No paperwork.
No lost orders.
No guessing what the kitchen is doing.
No guessing what is still open.

FestFlow becomes the silent coordination center of your event.
